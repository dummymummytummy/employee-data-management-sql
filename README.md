## About the Project

This project simulates my work as a **Data Analyst** within an **international company’s business operations team**.  
My responsibilities included designing and executing SQL queries in **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to explore, clean, and analyze organizational data related to employees, customers, vendors, and regional operations.  

The SQL scripts in this repository demonstrate practical skills applied in real-world data analytics:
- Querying and joining multiple relational tables  
- Building summary and subquery reports for executive insights  
- Tracking performance across international branches and suppliers  
- Writing clear, efficient, and well-documented SQL code

## Business Scenario

As part of the **Business Analytics Department** for an international trading company, I supported projects that helped management improve efficiency and decision-making across regions.  
The company operates in both **U.S.** and **U.K.** markets, so data integration and consistency were essential for analysis.  

Key business objectives included:
- Understanding **vendor payment performance** using the AP database  
- Evaluating **employee productivity** across regional branches (London vs. global teams)  
- Preparing for **U.K. expansion** by updating and restructuring employee data  
- Managing data integrity through action queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)  

All queries were executed using **Microsoft SQL Server**, with results validated through exploratory analysis and reporting views.
