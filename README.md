# Employee Data Management SQL

**Employee and Vendor Data Analytics Project (SQL Server)**  
Developed as part of internal analytics work for an international business operations team, focusing on employee management, vendor performance, and data-driven decision-making.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates my work as a **Data Analyst** within an international company’s business operations team.  
I designed and executed SQL queries in **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to explore, clean, and analyze organizational data related to employees, customers, vendors, and regional operations.

The project demonstrates practical skills applied in real-world analytics, including:

- Querying and joining multiple relational tables  
- Building summary and subquery reports for executive insights  
- Tracking performance across international branches and suppliers  
- Writing clear, efficient, and well-documented SQL code

## Business Scenario

As part of the Business Analytics Department for an international trading company, I supported projects that helped management improve efficiency and decision-making across regions.  

The company operates in both U.S. and U.K. markets, so data integration and consistency were essential. Key business objectives included:

- Understanding vendor payment performance using the AP database  
- Evaluating employee productivity across regional branches (London vs. global teams)  
- Preparing for U.K. expansion by updating and restructuring employee data  
- Managing data integrity through action queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)  

All queries were executed using **Microsoft SQL Server**, with results validated through exploratory analysis and reporting views.
